* MUST BE RUN ON CMD OR POWERSHELL TO PLAY GAME AT THE END (IDLE DOES NOT PRINT PROPERLY) *
* RUN ON POWERSHELL FOR BEST EXPERIENCE *
* ENTER 'py ' + FILE LOCATION (ex: 'py C:\\Users\\Jerem\\Documents\\Python\\TerraExodus2122.py') *

* ALL ASCII ART WAS MADE BY MYSELF WITH OCCASIONAL INSPIRATION FROM OTHER ASCII ART OR IMAGES *

Using ASCII art, this program takes in user input to display a story seemingly controlled by the user.
Every choice is recorded and used later which allows customization for the game at the end.
At the end, the user gets to play a game that uses all the options the user selected.

The goal of the game:
- Defeat all enemies of the user's choosing using the plane and weapons chosen by the user as well.
- The enemies will attempt to drop bombs in order to defeat the player, which will damage the plane.
- If the player's plane's health falls below or at 0, the player loses and may play again.
- However, if the player defeats all enemies, the player wins.
